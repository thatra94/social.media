on this project i started with setting up all the dependencies and structure of the project.
Added server and frontend code for signup and login from lesson 08.
Later on i modified this signup code to also include surname, hometown and date of birth. 
This would later be used for the profile of the users. 
After doing some testing on the login I found out that since I was
showing the profile info based on what was written in the sign up form the info
would not be shown if I used the login method instead on an existing user.
